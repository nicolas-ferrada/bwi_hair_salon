## Why this project?

This project is an assigment from a selection process of a Flutter intership.

#### Instructions were: 

"Build a small app using screens attached with this assignment. App needs to have firebase phone login and should be able to read data from firestore on home and category screen. Data should not be static. Text and images should be read from firestore and firestorage respectively."

## Content of the app

The application has a login with a phone using Firebase Auth. When the user creates its account, it goes to the home page, where the app reads all the data from Firebase Firestore, creating different 'Section' objects to display the information on the different widgets. Those functional and adaptative widgets I created were taken from the images designs (UI) they sent me to.

## Time

This entire project took me five days from start to finish.
